The Mission
Meet the brilliant yet eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown, better known as Doc. He is hopelessly stuck in 2023 and is repairing his time machine to save a friend. To avoid drawing attention to his grandiose project, Doc uses different email addresses and phone numbers for every purchase he makes at FluxKart.com.
